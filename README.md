## Description:

---

Welcome to my GetYourWorkDayStarted application. If you need help getting your day organized this is the repo for you. The usage section will have more detail on how to use this application. This application was built with html, javascript, and css. To add and format the times I used [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/). This application is meant for someone with a busy schedule and needs a daily planner to help them manage their time effectively.

The grey sections are time that has passed. In these areas the user will not be able to add or edit entries for that time block.

In the green sections the user can add what they need to do for that hour.

The red area indicates the current hour. You can't edit the current hour you're on.
